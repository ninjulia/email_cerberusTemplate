### Project Goal and Method

Email designed and coded as the first in a series of four emails on behalf of an IT SaaS provider to nurture prospective customers. 

The email showcased here was built on the purchased Cerberus email framework by Ted Goas, leveraging both his expertise and the ability to quickly stand up this email set. 

Images and code are modified from the original email. Changes were made to account for modern (2021) email service provider standards/quirks and darkmode.
